# public_docs
Just a place to put public docs.

GitHub's built in editor supports gfm (*of course*).  At least if you get the syntax ***right***.

Unfortunately, I don't know the method very well ~~yet~~.

Sample table syntax:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | Display the help window.|
| Close     | Closes a window     |

And of course being able to modify this from vim is even better.
